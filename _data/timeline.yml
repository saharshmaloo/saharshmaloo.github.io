  from: January, 2025  
  to: Present  
  description:  As a Software Engineer at Camp Starfish, I built a photo web app for over 300 campers  
                using Next.js, Firebase, and AWS Rekognition, automating more than 95% of the photo tagging process.  
                To improve efficiency, I developed an automated scheduling system for over 50 campers per session,  
                reducing conflicts by 60%. Additionally, I optimized Firestore queries, cutting photo retrieval time by 40%,  
                and implemented secure role-based authentication. Leading the front-end development using React, TypeScript,  
                and TailwindCSS, I ensured a highly responsive UI across all devices.

  description:  During my time at Quadrant Technologies, I helped develop and launch *Vamsa*,  
                a social media app designed to connect families with their heritage.  
                Leading the front-end development in React Native, I created an intuitive user experience  
                while integrating the app with an Azure SQL Database backend.  
                I also designed a graph-based database schema, reducing query times by 40%  
                and ensuring scalability to support over a million records.  
                Additionally, I automated deployment with Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines,  
                reducing build times by 25% and ensuring 99.99% uptime.  
                Beyond development, I contributed to financial strategy by identifying key metrics  
                for a $150M market opportunity.
